# Research Plan for Toxic Exposure Addition 


## Background

Questions regarding toxic exposure were added to the paper 21-526EZ form following the PACT act and there is need to digitize that section within the online form. This test will allow participants to go through a prototype in which they answer questions about toxic exposure type, location and time frame. 

**User goals:**

- Sucessfully report toxic exposure so that their conditions can be considered for presumptive service connection and claims processors can find toxic exposure related evidence in the Veteran's files.
- Successfully gather evidence related to severity of their condition not service-connection, saving time collecting evidence

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

**Priotities specific to VA.GOV generally:**
- Solidify the VA.gov platform
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims

**OCTO priorities specific to our product set by PO:**
- Increase engagement on the online platform
- Reduce errors and ambiguity in submitted claims (thus reducing processing time)
- Build trust with customers (Veterans)
- Reduce VA costs by automating / digitizing where possible

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

- Taking care of myself 
- Aging - some PACT act applicants are older veterans of the Vietnam War

## Research Goals	
*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

- Test form content clarity and comprehension
- Test fatigue and screen weariness within this subsection (we cannot currently test total effects
  

### Outcome
This research will allow our team to continue to progress toward complete alignment of the paper and digitial form.

### Research questions

- How do users find the langauge around claim for increase in the form in relation to toxic exposure?
- Is the order of questions asked meaningful? what are the points of confusion? 
- Is the revised evidence overview helpful?
- Do veterans know how to answer "how is your disability related to your service?" 

Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
We expect that the added toxic exposure questions will allow veterans to report roxic exposure seamlessly and prepare them for the process of gathering evidence for presumptive conditions and non-presumptive conditions.

## Methodology	 

We will be conducting 8-10 usability tests on mobile. 

Additional resources:
- Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project. 
- Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recruiting-Participants.1958773044.html) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support. 
- If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the [mobile research guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Conducting-Research-Sessions.1958773061.html#ConductingResearchSessions-Researchingwithmobileusers)
- If conducting [unmoderated usability research, refer to the guidance here.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Planning-Unmoderated-Studies.1904738369.html) 
- If conducting [research with disabled Veterans, refer to this checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-with-assistive-technology-users) and [follow disability etiquette guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/disability-etiquette)
- In the rare event of an emergency during research, be prepared by reviewing guidelines for [research safety and emergency exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).

### Location

Remote over Zoom 

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach

As the form entry points are used by veterans and active duty service members at varying stages, we would like to recruit for both. Additionally, the form entrance is applicable to a number of personas including but not limited to those claiming for increased perspective, those filing presumptive claims, those claiming and suffering from PTSD, and those filing before discharge, and those who may not yet be elligible to file yet. Consequently, we plan to recruit for veterans who cover at least two: filing before discharge and filing for presumptive claims as Medallia survey feedback shows that these scenraios represent the motives of many visitors to the 526 form entry pages.


Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.




### Recruitment criteria






Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

- diversity in cognitive ability - 40% identifying as having a cognitive disability 
- diversity in Race/ethnicity - 30% not identifiying as White 
- diversity gender - 20% not identifying as cis male 
- diversity in sexuality - 30% not identifying as straight
